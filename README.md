A small and leaky AngularJS application used to demonstrate how to identify, analyse and resolve memory leaks in JavaScript applications.

This is a companion to the article [Fixing Memory Leaks in AngularJS and other JavaScript Applications](http://www.dwmkerr.com/fixing-memory-leaks-in-angularjs-applications/).

## Using the Code

Clone, install and gulp!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dwmkerr/angular-memory-leaks.git 
cd angular-memory-leaks
npm install && bower install
gulp

Running gulp will serve the app, lint, and reload the browser when you change the code.
